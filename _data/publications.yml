- title: A Snowballing Literature Study on Test Amplification
  abstract: >
    The adoption of agile development approaches has put an increased emphasis on developer testing, resulting in software projects with strong test suites. These suites include a large number of test cases, in which developers embed knowledge about meaningful input data and expected properties in the form of oracles. This article surveys various works that aim at exploiting this knowledge in order to enhance these manually written tests with respect to an engineering goal (e.g., improve coverage of changes or increase the accuracy of fault localization). While these works rely on various techniques and address various goals, we believe they form an emerging and coherent field of research, which we call `test amplification'. We devised a first set of papers from DBLP, looking for all papers containing `test' and `amplification' in their title. We reviewed the 70 papers in this set and selected the 4 papers that fit our definition of test amplification. We use these 4 papers as the seed for our snowballing study, and systematically followed the citation graph. This study is the first that draws a comprehensive picture of the different engineering goals proposed in the literature for test amplification. In particular, we note that the goal of test amplification goes far beyond maximizing coverage only. We believe that this survey will help researchers and practitioners entering this new field to understand more quickly and more deeply the intuitions, concepts and techniques used for test amplification.

- title: A comprehensive study of pseudo-tested methods
  publication_date: 2018-9-19
  journal: Empirical Software Engineering
  abstract: >
    "Pseudo-tested methods are defined as follows: they are covered by the test suite, yet no test case fails when the method body is removed, i.e., when all the effects of this method are suppressed. This intriguing concept was coined in 2016, by Niedermayr and colleagues, who showed that such methods are systematically present, even in well-tested projects with high statement coverage. This work presents a novel analysis of pseudo-tested methods. First, we run a replication of Niedermayr’s study with 28K+ methods, enhancing its external validity thanks to the use of new tools and new study subjects. Second, we perform a systematic characterization of these methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively with an extensive manual analysis of 101 pseudo-tested methods. The first part of the study confirms Niedermayr’s results: pseudo-tested methods exist in all our subjects. Our in-depth characterization of pseudo-tested methods leads to two key insights: pseudo-tested methods are significantly less tested than the other methods; yet, for most of them, the developers would not pay the testing price to fix this situation. This calls for future work on targeted test generation to specify those pseudo-tested methods without spending developer time."

- title: "Descartes: a PITest engine to detect pseudo-tested methods. Tool demonstration"
  publication_date: 2018-9-3
  conference: ASE 2018-33rd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Automated Software Engineering
  abstract: >
    Descartes is a tool that implements extreme mutation operators and aims at finding pseudo-tested methods in Java projects. It leverages the efficient transformation and runtime features of PITest. The demonstration compares Descartes with Gregor, the default mutation engine provided by PITest, in a set of real open source projects. It considers the execution time, number of mutants created and the relationship between the mutation scores produced by both engines. It provides some insights on the main features exposed by Descartes.

  abstract: >
    "The choice of parameters has a strong influence on the quality of the results obtained by the application of algorithms. Most researchers tend to select the values of their parameters in long and tedious trial and error approaches. Although, some methods have been developed for automatic parameter selection, they have not been widely used in the computer vision area. This paper presents the design of a general purpose framework for automatic parameter selection through a case study: a human limb tracking algorithm developed for applications that will be used in rehabilitation scenarios with low cost equipment. The tracking algorithm first detects the limb by using a skin segmentation approach, then the position of an idealized limb model is updated using Simulated Annealing. The framework for automatic parameter selection treats each parameter from the tracking algorithm according to its domain and uses a modified version of Harmony Search Optimization algorithm that includes a dominance criterion. The obtained results are presented as well and show that selected parameters behave well for the case of study."

    In this work, an algorithm for human limb movement tracking is presented. This proposal considers the problem as an optimisation problem and attempts to solve it using an implementation of simulated annealing aided by detected skin features. The parameters of the presented algorithm are set using a general-purpose framework for automatic parameter selection. Application on small video sequences shows good results with selected parameters. Also, some drawbacks of the methods to be considered in practical use are discussed. This technique has been designed for use in the development of a real-time interaction interface in video games for rehabilitation of patients with motor disabilities, and as an offline pose analysis framework to evaluate individual progress in the therapy of those patients.

  volume: 2
  issue: 1
  pages: 62-70
  abstract: >
    In this paper we present details about the implementation of computer vision based applications for the rehabilitation of patients with motor disabilities. The applications are conceived as serious games, where the computer-patient interaction during playing contributes to the development of different motor skills. The use of computer vision methods allows the automatic guidance of the patient’s movements making constant specialized supervision unnecessary. The hardware requirements are limited to low-cost devices like usual webcams and Netbooks.

- title: Active contour algorithm for texture segmentation using a feature set
  publication_date: 2008-12-8
  conference: ICPR 2008 - 19th International Conference on Pattern Recognition
  abstract: >
    This paper presents a novel algorithm for unsupervised texture segmentation. We incorporate a set of texture features under a segmentation framework, based on the active contour without edges model with level set representation and a connected component filtering strategy. The experiments performed show that, it can be used for segmentation of multiple-textured images, with a segmentation quality that achieves up to 96% of average using our own quantitatively image quality measure, which allows the comparison between the segmented image versus its ground truth image.
